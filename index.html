    <p>I write regularly on <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh">HEY World</a> and speak on <a href="https://37signals.com/podcast/">The REWORK Podcast</a>. I welcome emails to <a href="mailto:dhh@hey.com">dhh@hey.com</a>. You can also find me <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">on Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-heinemeier-hansson-374b18221/">on LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dhhdrives/">on Instagram</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="rails">Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>Hundreds of thousands of programmers around the world have built amazing applications using <a href="average-price-for-brunei-properties.html">Ruby on Rails</a>. The open-source web framework that I created in 2003. Some of the more famous include <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>, <a href="https://shopify.com">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://squareup.com">Square</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv">Twitch</a>, and <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="basecamp">Cofounder of Basecamp & HEY</h2>
    <p><a href="https://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> is the one-place-not-all-over-the-place way to organize your projects and your company. Launched in <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/archives/000542.php">2004</a> as one of the first software-as-a-service applications, and used by millions of people since. It's the original Rails application.</p>

    <p><a href="https://hey.com">HEY</a> is a fresh approach to turning email into something you want to use, not something you’re forced to deal with. A complete alternative to Gmail or Outlook for individuals and companies who want a better relationship with email. Tens of thousands of customers have embraced it since we launched in 2020.</p>

    <p><a href="https://37signals.com">37signals</a> is the company behind both Basecamp and HEY. I own that business together with Jason Fried.</p>


    <h2 id="rework">Best-selling author</h2>
    <p>I've written four books together with Jason Fried. All on the lessons we've extracted from running 37signals in an unconventional way over the last twenty-plus years.</p>

    <p><a href="https://basecamp.com/books/rework/">REWORK</a> is a New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Sunday Times best seller with more than half a million copies sold. It's a book about starting and running businesses a better way.</p>

    <p><a href="https://basecamp.com/books/calm/">It Doesn't Have To Be Crazy At Work</a> is about how to run a calm company by avoiding the lure of excessive growth and making your time count for more.</p>

    <p><a href="https://basecamp.com/books/remote/">REMOTE: Office Not Required</a> encapsulated all we'd learned  working remotely for over a decade. Ahead of its time, but suddenly extremely relevant after 2020.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://basecamp.com/books/getting-real/">Getting Real</a> shared everything we learned building Basecamp and a software business back in the early days. Still on point.</p>

    <h2 id="driver">Le Mans & WEC class-winning racing driver</h2>
    <p>I raced in the FIA <a href="https://www.fiawec.com">World Endurance Championship</a> for seven years. In 2014, I won my class with Aston Martin in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWR0B8LvA3g">the 82nd running of the 24 hours of Le Mans</a> – the world's biggest endurance race. I also won <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkYQPBYWJQo">the WEC championship</a> in the GTE-Am category that year. But mostly, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNQl0x6WS3M">raced in LMP2 prototypes</a>. I've finished on the podium at Le Mans four times in nine appearances. In 2023, <a href="https://sportscar365.com/lemans/wec/jota-signs-fittipaldi-heinemeier-hansson-to-lmp2-program/">I'm back in the FIA WEC</a>, driving another LMP2 for JOTA Sport.</p>

    <h2 id="antitrust">Antitrust advocate</h2>
    <p>Big tech monopolies are in urgent need of being brought back under control of democracies. I've been testifying in favor of antitrust action before the <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/testimony-before-the-house-antitrust-subcommittee/">House Antitrust Subcommittee</a>, the <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/on-apples-monopoly-power-to-destroy-hey/">democratic side of the House Antitrust Subcommittee</a>, the <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/testimony-before-the-north-dakota-senate-industry-business-and-labor-committee/">North Dakota Senate</a>, and the <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/testimony-before-the-arizona-house-of-representatives-e48f3e89">Arizona House of Representatives</a>. As well as spoken at length with US and EU regulators about the problem. We had <a href="https://www.hey.com/apple/">a big monopoly-power battle with Apple</a> when we launched HEY.</p>

    <h2 id="investor">Investor in Danish startups</h2>
    <p>I'm committed to helping Danish software entrepreneurs build the next generation of strong companies with solid roots in Denmark. I've so far invested in <a href="https://workfeed.io">Workfeed</a>, <a href="https://jumpstory.com">JumpStory</a>, <a href="https://www.ziik.io">Ziik</a>, <a href="https://turis.app">Turis</a>, and <a href="https://servicelovers.com">Servicelovers</a>. I focus exclusively on software businesses (invest in what you know!) that's based in Denmark and intend to remain there. <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/reconsider/">Not interested in hunting unicorns</a>, but love helping solid startups avoid venture capital.</p>

Note:

Prices are in BND.
Outliers are removed for property listing prices above $1,000,000 because it will affect the average prices.
There are other various factors to consider when pricing the property aside from the property location and the property type. Other factors is the property size, number of rooms, property status (proposed, under construction, ready-built), permanent or on-lease.
There’s a couple of missing values for the property size which makes it quite difficult to determine the degree of correlation between the price of property and the size of property.

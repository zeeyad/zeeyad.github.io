The plan of the blog is to detail out my Data Science personal projects. 

In July 2021, I've completed a PowerBI Data Analyst Certification Examination by Microsoft where it provide fundamental understanding on the discovering insights into the data and creating data visualizations. 

For the past few months, I've been working on Kaggle datasets to gain further understanding on Machine Learning Techniques specifically Regression and Classification. 

Generally, I like to build a prototype site so I've something more concrete so I will build a prototype something similar to a predictive-blogging site like [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) as soon as I can.
